Loop Arbor Trace through the trees, up some nice climbs and come back the way you came once you've done the loop past the farm. Then hit the Green trail as it runs up behind the outdoor center to the left and climb an access road and you'll see a sign leading to the black trail behind the old Chicken coop (reddish-orange clay building). There is also a green trail off to the right and a blue trail access of it, about a mile in.  these are some cool trail; beginner to intermediate in nature. The black trail is label such because of some climbs and tight switchbacks, but pretty tame compared to DuPont, Bent Creek, Tsali. The green is rideable with a hybrid bike. HAVE FUN.",

It is normally only open from Boxing Day to Easter Monday.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />Here is a description of the route taken from http://www.nzcycletrail.com/rainbow-trail...&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&quot;The Rainbow Trail starts approximately 9 km east of St Arnaud at the Rainbow Road turn-off on State Highway 63.  The trail starts with a sealed section of road that winds its way to the Old Rainbow Homestead and toll gate where you will pay the $2 fee during the open season.  Permission for access is required outside the open season.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&quot;Beyond the old Rainbow Homestead and toll gate the Rainbow experience really begins.  The trail fords a number of streams and crosses a bridge over the Wairau River before entering 'Hell's Gate', a scenic narrow gorge.  You'll find the Coldwater Creek campsite just above the gorge and the boundary between Rainbow and Molesworth stations is just a little further on from there.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&quot;The turn off to the Sedgemere Sleepout is located just after the trail recrosses the Wairau - it's a few hundred metres down a side road off the trail.  A short detour past the sleepout carpark will provide you with a spectacular view over several high country lakes.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&quot;Island Saddle marks the highest point on this route and the boundary between Marlborough and Canterbury.  Not far from Island Saddle, a further detour (3 km) will take you to Lake Tennyson, a scenic lake formed by a glacial moraine dam - and an ideal spot for a picnic.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&quot;Approaching Hanmer Springs there is a 3-way intersection at the top of Jacks Pass.  If you're keen for more cycling, continue left here on to the Molesworth Muster Trail, a 207 km cycle trail through Molesworth Station to Blenheim.  Though you might want to stop in Hanmer to restock supplies first.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />&quot;Heading right down Clarence Valley Road, you'll enjoy a long downhill into the Hanmer Springs township and a soak in the famous hot thermal springs.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />The route is used for a celebrated annual mountain bike race called the Rainbow Rage. http://www.rainbowrage.co.nz.  The photos on Singletracks were taken during this event a few years ago.",

MORC has taken the initiative in working with Dakota County to turn a really marginal doubletrack XC ski loop into the best riding in the Metro. In 2002 we added a new beginner (warm-up) loop directly out of the parking lot. It heads off from the southwest corner of the parking lot and wanders through the pine trees and grass fields of the north end of the park.  Look for a new double expert loop to open up sometime early 2003!  The rest of the trail loop starts at the same place, but heads up the gravel doubletrack. After a good climb and some rolling descents there is new singletrack heading off to the left. This dives into existing trail removing a few hundred yards of wide open field riding. This singletrack is really fun. It's fast, it's smooth, and it's winding. There's a good mix of everything... trees, rocks, roots. Where the old 'new' singletrack used to end and rejoin the XC ski trail, there is brand new singletrack that heads out straight across the doubletrack.  This is one of the best areas of the entire park.  It's wide open rolling singletrack. Once you get an idea of what the corners are like, you can really fly. This is a great intermediate singletrack section that would be fun for people of varied abilities. At the end of this new singletrack section you hop back onto the gravel doubletrack and start immediately into a new bypass climb. This climb last about a quarter of a mile.  This bypass replaced the real steep gravel climbs that are now closed and being re-claimed due to erosion.   The next section you come to is the expert/advanced singletrack.  The trail is still really fun, but not nearly as insane as it used to be. There's still one log crossing in there that's steep enough that it gouges your big chainring despite lifting your wheels as you ride over it. The advanced singletrack section is much tighter than the rest of the singletrack at Lebanon, and has quite a few rock sections. The rocks are a ton of fun, and really well situated. Where the advanced singletrack section ends, you hang a right on some dirt doubletrack and head for the tree line. Just before you go into the trees, there's a new section heading off to the left. This new section replaces some older eroding XC ski trail.  We did a lot of work to seed old trail back into nature last year and hope everyone enjoys the new routes that have been created.  This last section is really a ton of fun as it has some fast winding descents. When you finish this, you're on the home stretch. Head back to the parking lot on double track, and start another lap.

You will climb gradually on this fairly well maintained dirt road for about 4.5 miles. Just after the road veers left, after the third chairlift, look for a road taking off to the right near a large maintenance building. There is a sign here but the day I rode this it was wrapped in plastic and leaning against a tree. At about 5 miles and crossing two ski runs, take the road to the right. Look for a round sign with a blue arrow. There are also bright red signs with bicycle symbol on them marking the trail. Many of these signs however are in disrepair so don't rely on them, but if you do see one you will know you are on the right trail. At this point the trail goes down through a meadow and accross a very small stream. After you cross the stream begin the climb up the westridge to the Colorado Trail. After about three miles the trail intersects the Colorado Trail. At this point you should see the markers (a triangle symbol) identifying the Colorado Trail. Take the sharp right here. Meander across the westridge for a few miles and stay left at the next fork (appx. 8 mi.) If you go right here you will go back down to Keystone gulch. From here the Colorado Trail begins it's long and fast descent toward Breckenridge. After a couple miles descending, the Colorado Trail will make a VERY sharp turn to the left and Red's trail will be the straight option. I believe there is a post at this intersection. Go straight onto Red's Trail and follow the narrow singletrack along a steep hillside and eventually back into the forest. After a few more miles this trail will terminate with a choice of dirt road to the left or more singletrack to the right. Take the single track to the right which is Keystone Ranch Trail. Follow this trail for a few miles. The golf course will be on your left. Cross a few roads and this trail will turn into the Aqueduct trail. Follow the aquaduct trail around the mountain and back to Keystone gulch. Once you come out on the road turn left back to your car.",

Although it is an excellent beginner trail, it still has a fair number of challenges, obstacles, and separate routes geared more towards experienced riders. The trail consists of three loops: an outer loop called the Ranger Loop, marked by blue, which is best for beginners, an inner loop called Wolverine, marked by orange, good for intermediate riders, and another inner loop called Redhawk, marked by red, and best for advanced riders. The total mileage of all the trail combined is 5 miles with about 400 feet of climbing. The trail is built on the side of a prarie hill and is mostly grassy with some good open field scenery. There are very few trees and very few roots which makes for an excellent, fast cross country course. Be sure to bring plenty of water on sunny days due to the lack of shade!&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />Visit www.dorba.org for more information.",

Those willing to take great risk can try their skills on the famous Portal Trail singletrack descent  to finish the loop.  Warning! The Portal Trail has some &quot;really extreme&quot; exposure and people have paid the ultimate price negotiating certain sections of this trail.Portal Trail is a very narrow singletrack that skirts the face of a near vertical cliff. Many people walk this part of the trail. Poison Spider Mesa is a challenging ride due to the attention required to negotiate loose terrain, babyheads, bedrock ledges, slickrock (lots of slickrock) and at times deep sand all on one of Moab's  classic  Jeep 4x4 trail. Once on the mesa ,there is much slickrock to play around on. The ride starts with a tough climb on bedrock and the occasional alluvial terrace or deep sand and then on to a flatter ledgy surface.  The trail turns curvy a bit then some confusion  awaits for finding the route to the slickrock. Once on the hallowed surface you can freeform ride to the mesa or follow the trail markers which are little painted Jeeps. If you choose to make your own way to the mesa, study the trail map first and keep a look out for certain landmarks to help you navagate to the rim. At any point along the trail you can turn around to make it an out and back ride.The mileage count  is assuming you follow the painted markers to the top, however, mileage becomes a moot point if you decide to freeform ride once on the slickrock.",

After you pass the blinking lights it is less than a half mile to the lake, where the road will continue to cross the lake. You can park before you cross the bridge, and take the asphalt path around the lake. You will come to a bridge, that crosses a spillway. Cross the bridge and the trail starts immediatly to your right. If you are coming from I-40, get off at Gorman Street and head towards NC State. When you get to the light you will be at the intersection of Gorman and Avent Ferry; turn left. Use the rest of the directions from above. If you want to ride the other side of the lake, you can cross the bridge on the road, and there is a turnoff on the right side of the road, the trail starts here.",

This trail can be rough on you back, wrists, etc. This trail, which is mostly singletrack, is a good trail to beat up yourself on. I first hated this trail but have come to like it seeing as how I am in such close proximity to it. Give it a try, you may be suprised. The other side of the trail across the bridge is now open again, and is is in better shape than the rootier (is that a word?!?) trail. This side of the lake, is not as rooty. Elevation change includes short uphills and descents.. Length is 1-2 miles.. This trail is not that tough, if you avoid the roots by riding the side of the trail. There are a few log crossings for the brave of heart (wait till you see them) and a few that I can cross (in other words, up to one foot-don't laugh). There is already erosion so its good not to ride this trail in the rain.  Kent has marked off a new trail at Lake Johnson. You can get there by staying on the paved path starting at the hilly side of the lake. Follow the paved path through the two large hills and start looking to the right as the paved path meets up with the loop on the left. There is an existing trail on the right that leads to Lake Dam Rd. Follow the trail approximately 1/4 mile and start looking for the bright pink markers on your left. The trail winds through a wooded meadow and ends up on a gravel road. Follow the gravel road to the right and it will take you to Lake Dam Rd. Go left on Lake Dam to the entrance of the park. A trail will soon be marked to get from the gravel road to the main part of Lake Johnson so you wont have to go back out to Lake Dam Rd. The new trail is fun and will eventually provide Lake Johnson with a full Loop ride instead of an out and back route. ",

I will also describe two possible ways that you could connect with the trail leading to the Presideo and to the end of the San Pedro trail system in Saint David. It is easiest to describe this loop trail going counter clockwise. From the map sign in the parking lot go North a short way along the path to the trail gate. Go through the gate and then ride the trail North. After a short distance there is a sign on the right marking the trail to the Fairbank Cemetery. No bikes are allowed on this trail. After about another mile there is a ruined mill on the right. About a half mile past this you'll come to a junction with a trail leading North down into a big wash. If you wanted to connect with the Presideo trail you would descend the trail to the dry wash. It is a short distance to the river which is usually quite shallow. You would then ford the river and make your way North and West. This is not a clearly marked trail. You would then cross the first abandoned railroad bed you come to and then make your way to the second railroad bed to the West. This is the trail leading North to the Presideo and beyond (see the Presideo Trail). To continue on this ride however just stay on the main trail as it heads West and then follows the  San Pedro River South. After about another mile you'll come to an abandoned railroad bridge on your right that leads across the river. It's possible to cross this bridge and connect with the Presideo trail (see the Presidio Trail) but for this ride follow the main trail South along the  abandoned railroad bed back to Fairbank. There are some sandy stretches on this section of the trail. Ride through the Fairbank tourist attraction and back to the parking lot to complete the four mile loop.",

The first part of the climb has a moderate grade, but the last half is brutal and unrelenting.  Be in shape or shuttle it--if I ever do this one again, I will.  As a shuttle, I'd give this four stars.  Climb up the Logging Creek road for 7 or so miles and head left when the road meets Divide Road (the sign will indicate you are going toward White Sulphur Springs.  Continue another 9 or so miles, past numerous trail.  When you see a sign on your left that says Deer Park, you're getting close.  A few more curves and you will see a sign indicating Pilgrim Creek to your left.  The singletrack starts off extremely rough--long fields of baby heads, both loose and embedded.  Then the trail begins its desdent.  It gets crazy steem in places--hang your b*** off the back or go over the bars.  There will be many drainage crossings with technical entry/exits.  You will also cross Pilgrim Creek numerous times. , not always rideabe, so you will get wet.  Along the route, you will encounter roots, rocks, drops, water, climbs, ruts, muddy bogs, loose dirt and sand--you name it.  This trail is also very remote and there is no escape from its interior--be self sufficient.  An adventure to be sure.",

In the middle of the bowl, if you take a left, you'll hit some of the fastest single track in the Gyro, which has wider turns, is mostly flat, and with some nice dips here and there.  Also a  long 2 x 4 that clears a gap you can skip if you're not comfortable with it.  Follow the track and it will come out close to the river (this is also where one of the other trail connects, so be on the lookout for other bikers).  Take the track along the lake and continue on (you'll see some smaller dirt jumps), ride over the see-saw, and you'll be out of the system and amidst some small houses.  You're back out on the road.  Take a right, and you can go back to the gas station.&lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />The second trailhead on the right begins the twistier single track where you'll have to watch your handlebars and weasel through some tighter spots.  This track is the longest, goes all over the place, comes out close to the river, but then turns back into the woods.  The trail will pass through a clearing and end up where that first trail comes out.  You can either continue on toward the river and finish out on the road, or you can turn on the faster single track and end your trip with the dirt bowl and come back out on the dirt service road. The trail on the left is not very twisty, it's quite short (fun too), and will pass by an impressive BMX/DJ section, before coming out in the parking lot of the first gas station you had earlier passed.  Try to turn it all into a big loop! &lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />Optional: If you want, keep taking that dirt service road back, go over an old bridge with holes in it, and into a field.  Best in the springtime when the grass is lower, but still very Little House on the Prairie any time of year.  If you see ATV/bike tracks, follow them and watch out for animal dwellings.  This leads (hopefully) to gravel road that you climb to a paved road.  Take a left, go down the road, take another left onto the next road (175), and ride back into Plymouth.  ",

There are lots of fun curves, some &lt;br /&gt;<br />steeps, a few surprises, and some beautiful woods. Very fun! About half is newly constructed, the other &lt;br /&gt;<br />half is an old road bed converted to singletrack. Total downhill is about 4-5 miles and drops 2200 vertical &lt;br /&gt;<br />feet. It can also be done as an out and back from Rd. 4137, but it's a tough climb. &lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />The downhill begins with a newly constructed section of fast, windy singletrack with lots of fun dips and &lt;br /&gt;<br />curves. After about 1.5-2 miles (?) of this, you come to a small saddle/mud pit where the trail makes a &lt;br /&gt;<br />hard left. After this left bend, the trail shoots you into a beautiful meadow with big views of the Big Belts. &lt;br /&gt;<br />This portion is fast and furious. The remainder of the trail alternates between old roadbed converted to ST &lt;br /&gt;<br />and recently built ST sections. Route finding is mostly very easy, but there is one hard left that you might &lt;br /&gt;<br />miss - look for a cairn on the left as you scream down a straight, steep section of old road grade about a &lt;br /&gt;<br />mile or so below the aforementioned saddle. The last mile is in the old Beartrap Gulch road grade and is &lt;br /&gt;<br />fast and smooth with some fun kelly humps. The trail ends at a fence. From here, continue straight down &lt;br /&gt;<br />to York Rd., about 250 feet further. Take a left and you're back at Vigilante camp in a few minutes. All &lt;br /&gt;<br />mileages are educated guesses. &lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />The new trail sections are still a bit soft when wet and may have some horse damage. This trail has the &lt;br /&gt;<br />potential to be a classic downhill, it just needs a few more riders to help pack it down. Camp at Vigilante for &lt;br /&gt;<br />$5 and ride Hanging Valley the next day. Stop by the Helena Nat'l. Forest Service office (now located on &lt;br /&gt;<br />Skyline Rd. across from the airport) for more info. ",

At the end of the connector trail you cross two pontoons to get on the Pointe Loop. This is still under construction but should be done by Fall 2014. There is also a downhill flow trail in the works.

There are some loose, large rocks here and there, but they are easy to avoid.  You climb to about 10,000 ft. when you get to the turnaround point.  Of course, the trail continues down the other side, if you want to explore.  Do further research of the area.  Be careful of bears.  Hikers and bikers are cautioned to not hike/ride alone, but if you are careful, carry bear spray, you should be okay.  I saw one, small black bear, but there are grizzlies.  I heard a local story that a biker was attacked by a grizzly years ago.  Just use caution and enjoy the incredible scenery.",

Continuing on the trail soon leaves the power line and takes off into the foothills crossing a couple ravines and creek beds but continually climbing. This isnât a really steep grade but the tread is small loose gravel with a few tech spots thrown in making it tough going. About 2 miles later you have done most of the climbing for this ride except for a few short sections here &amp; there. &lt;br /&gt;<br />This route is marked pretty well except for a couple places, this is one of them- follow a jeep rd down the hill .2 of a mile, staying right keep your eye on the other bike tracks as they follow a jeep rd through a ravine and then turn left on the other side, there are signs from here on. The trail soon leaves the road and becomes a fast and challenging singletrack for a couple miles. Lots of rocks, small drops and banked corners with cacti for guard rails line this section that eventually comes to another road. Follow this to the right for less than a hundred yards and hang a left at the marker and then follow the singletrack off road. This next half mile section is called the Devils Escalator, sorry but your going up here- steep with switchbacks but nothing to technical, at the top catch your breath, enjoy the view and follow the road right down the hill and then the singletrack at the bottom. &lt;br /&gt;<br />This section is all a gradual grade down making a very fast ride across the desert sand and cactus. 3 miles later and after paralleling a road for a little while watch for a trail heading across the road to the left and another singletrack heading back up the other side, this will be the trail that leads you back north. An overlook on the ridge gives you a great view of the entire Vegas valley. The singletrack runs alongside the road for a while then takes off, climbs just over a small rise and then heads down into Red Canyon, a fast and technical course through rocks and trees in a tight canyon. About halfway down you come to an intersection with a short connector trail that leads up to the Badger Pass Loop tr. &lt;br /&gt;<br />Continuing on down the canyon you will end up a paring lot and will be able to see where you originally parked about .6 of a mile away. As you start down the road you can take it all the way to your car, or if you still havent had enough take a trail across the road that turns into another mile of singletrack winding its way back to the original trail under the powerline. &lt;br /&gt;<br />&lt;br /&gt;<br />* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *&lt;br /&gt;<br />After reading this description it does seem a bit much, however out there on the trail its really not that difficult at all. Most all of the intersections are marked and its really easy just to follow the other tire tracks. It also sounds like a lot of jeep road riding but not that much, if the singletrack hitâs a road watch for it to exit the other side very shortly. &lt;br /&gt;<br />",

Ride in access is free so park at the nearby shopping center and ride in! Trail maps are available at the Mt.

After the first couple of hundred yards the trail becomes sandy and loaded with moguls, whoop dee dos or whatever you want to call them. They were apparently put on the trail to discourage dirt bikes/ATV's and off road vehicles. The mounds and alot of fun for a mountain bike and the sand adds a bit of a challenge.After about the first half mile you can veer left onto Sprig Tree Path. Sprig Tree is closer to single track and has not too much sand. A few gentle climbs and descents. It's a very scenic ride and quite easy for beginners. Sprig Tree criscrosses the Railroad Trail a few times. After about the mile and a half point you will cross under power lines, you can stay on Sprig Tree(or go back to the Railroad Trail, see below *) and then turn right onto  Crooked Pond Trail. You get a great scene as you go around Crooked Pond . Continue on Crooked Pond Trail to the second trail you can turn left onto. Make the left onto Old Farm Road. After a half mile turn left onto Widow Gavitts Path. Take Widow Gavitts Path to the first trail on your left . Take that trail back to Crooked Path Trail ( second trail to your right) and start your loop back. &lt;br /&gt;<br /> *If you stay on the railroad trail after the powerlines after about a half mile there is a trail that cuts off to your left. Taking this trail will give you about a 50 foot drop onto Crooked Pond Trail. It's fairly steep and pretty eroded so I didn't do it. But if your a downhiller this will give you some excitement.&lt;br /&gt;<br />If you want to you can also stay on the Railroad Trail all the way to Bridgehampton",
